                       whose lives can be transformed with our help. At present, 60 per cent of India’s population, or an estimated 812 million people, live below that poverty line.
                       Hence, we have a massive task ahead of us to be able to connect with these 812 million people and empower them to become active and contributing members of the society.

                       Our trust was founded with the concerted efforts of eminent Astrologer Krishna Sharma. She has dedicated her life to studying Hindu scriptures, particularly about Astrology
                       and spreading that knowledge among the masses, removing superstitions and misunderstandings about Hinduism. 
                       <br/><br/><p>
                       She is a known face in Indian Telivision channels that stream shows on astrology and has frequently appeared on well known news channels like AajTak, News18, TV9 Bharatvarsh, etc where
                       she has not only appeared in weekly astrology shows as the host but also participated in numerous debates on religion and current affairs. She has used these platforms to stand for the truth
                       and bust myths and prejudices imparted by psuedo Gurus in the name of Hinduism. She also creates content related to Astrology on her Youtube Channel - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpnxEH82NwNJanr-IxZs7-Q" target="_blank">Krishtara Divya Lau Channel</a>
                       </p>
                       <br/><p>
                       Deeply inspired from the ideals of Hinduism, she dedicates a large part of her time to uplifting the underprivileged sections of the society by empowering them with education and vocational skills
                       to gain employment. She also organises workshops and classes in temples and community halls to educate the general public about Sanskrit, the mother of all languages and the Shastras.
                      </p><br/><p>
                       Till now she has single-handedly raised hunds and used her personal finances to achieve this mission, but your cooperations can help her in this noble task.
